1.
We’re going to do a mathematical “magic” trick. Create a variable, $my_num and assign as its value any number.

Next, create a second variable, $answer and assign $my_num as its value.

2.
Use the addition assignment operator to add 2 to $answer.

3.
Use the multiplication assignment operator to multiply $answer by 2.

4.
Use the subtraction assignment operator to subtract 2 from $answer.

5.
Use the division assignment operator to divide $answer by 2.

6.
Almost there. Use the subtraction assignment operator to subtract your original number ($my_num) from $answer. Finally, use echo to print $answer to the terminal.

If everything went as it should, $answer should be 1. No matter what your original number was!
